22          This may generate a warning during your build:
23          
24           > property#android.adservices.AD_SERVICES_CONFIG@android:resource
25           > was tagged at AndroidManifest.xml:23 to replace other declarations
26           > but no other declaration present
27           
28           You may safely ignore this warning.
29           
30           We must include this in case you also use something else
31           that may also include this file, because if two modules include it, they
32           will collide and cause a build error if we don't set this one to take
33           priority via replacement.
